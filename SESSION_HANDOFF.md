# Session Handoff - Ghost v9.5 Railway Deployment

## Current Status (September 22, 2025)
Ghost is fully configured and ready for Railway deployment with all necessary instruments restored.

## What We Accomplished
1. ✅ Fixed Ghost's identity (now responds as "Ghost" not "Agent Zero")
2. ✅ Configured smart contact enrichment logic in prompts
3. ✅ Restored critical instruments from agent-zero-heavy:
   - trinity_blade (graph operations)
   - graphrag_query/ingest/delete (entity extraction)
   - search_engine (web search)
   - document_query (document analysis)
   - scheduler (task scheduling)
   - notify_user (notifications)
   - secrets_manager (API keys)
4. ✅ Removed restrictive tools.md that was blocking instruments
5. ✅ Verified all Python implementations exist for instruments

## Current Configuration
- **Container**: agent-zero-lite running on port 50003
- **Database**: FalkorDB on ports 3002/6381
- **Railway URL**: https://legacyghost.up.railway.app
- **Local Ghost**: http://localhost:50003
- **Legacy Compass**: Running on port 8000

## Files Modified
- `agents/agent0/_context.md` - Updated Ghost identity
- `agents/agent0/prompts/agent.system.main.role.md` - Ghost personality & contact logic
- `agents/agent0/prompts/agent.system.tools.md` - DELETED (was blocking instruments)
- `instruments/custom/` - Added 9 instrument folders from heavy system

## Next Steps
1. **Commit changes to git**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Restore Ghost instruments and fix identity for Railway deployment"
   ```

2. **Push to Railway**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   Railway should auto-deploy from the GitHub repo

3. **Verify deployment**
   - Check https://legacyghost.up.railway.app
   - Test Ghost has all instruments available
   - Verify FalkorDB connection if needed

## Important Notes
- Instruments are token-free (preloaded into memory)
- The `{{instruments}}` placeholder loads them automatically
- All instruments have matching Python implementations in `/python/tools/`
- Contact_management was removed (not needed, no Python backend)

## Docker Status
- agent-zero-lite container is healthy
- FalkorDB container is healthy
- Both using minimal resources (~5% CPU combined)

## Todo Items Remaining
- Commit all changes to git
- Push to Railway deployment
- (Optional) Connect to Legacy Compass production
- (Optional) Deploy FalkorDB for persistent memory

Ready for fresh session with clean context!
