# E2B Desktop Tool - SIMPLE ACTIONS ONLY

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Use SIMPLE, SINGLE actions

This tool does NOT support complex instructions. Break tasks into individual steps.

## Actions:

### Start Desktop
```
tool_name: e2b_desktop
action: start
```

### Navigate (BEST FOR URLS)
```
tool_name: e2b_desktop
action: navigate
url: https://congress.gov
```

### Screenshot
```
tool_name: e2b_desktop
action: screenshot
```

### Click at coordinates
```
tool_name: e2b_desktop
action: click
x: 500
y: 300
```

### Type text
```
tool_name: e2b_desktop
action: type
text: "firearm laws"
```

### Simple Control (BASIC ONLY)
```
tool_name: e2b_desktop
action: control
instruction: "navigate to congress.gov"  # SIMPLE commands only
```

## ‚ùå DO NOT USE COMPLEX INSTRUCTIONS

WRONG:
```
action: control
instruction: "Visit 8 websites, search for laws, take screenshots, save to files..."
```

RIGHT:
```
Step 1:
action: navigate
url: https://congress.gov

Step 2:
action: screenshot

Step 3:
action: type
text: "firearm"
```

## For Complex Research Tasks:

Break it down into individual steps:
1. Navigate to first site
2. Take screenshot
3. Navigate to next site
4. Take screenshot
5. Repeat for each site

Use SEPARATE tool calls for each action!
