# GraphRAG Ingest Tool

## Purpose
The GraphRAG ingest tool processes arbitrary text and extracts entities, relationships, and knowledge into a structured graph database. This tool builds dynamic ontologies from ingested content and enables sophisticated knowledge queries.

## When to Use
- Ingesting documents, articles, or research materials
- Processing meeting notes or conversation transcripts  
- Adding structured knowledge from unstructured text
- Building knowledge graphs from code documentation
- Creating searchable knowledge bases from text sources

## Parameters
- **text** (required): The textual content to analyze and store
- **instruction** (optional): Extraction guidance for the LLM (e.g., "focus on people and organizations", "extract technical concepts and relationships")

## Usage Examples

text: "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976. The company is headquartered in Cupertino, California and is known for products like the iPhone and MacBook."
instruction: "focus on companies, people, and products"
```

## Best Practices
