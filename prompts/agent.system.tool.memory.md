## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: SAVE ALL COMPLEX NARRATIVES IMMEDIATELY
## When user shares ANY story, test case, or multi-entity scenario - SAVE IT NOW!

## Memory Management System

### ðŸŽ¯ COMPLEXITY DETECTION - When to Auto-Save
**Automatically use memory_save when input contains:**
- **Multiple Named Entities** (3+ people, places, or things with names)
- **Relationships** (X works at Y, A married to B, C owns D)
- **Structured Data** (lists, hierarchies, org charts, menus)
- **Temporal Information** (dates, timelines, sequences of events)
- **Paradoxes or Complex Logic** (circular dependencies, contradictions)
- **Financial/Numerical Data** (prices, stats, measurements)
- **Long Narratives** (>200 words of interconnected information)

**Complexity Score - Save if 2+ are true:**
âœ“ Has 5+ named entities (people, companies, places)
âœ“ Has relationship descriptions (works at, married to, owns)
âœ“ Has structured sections/lists
âœ“ Contains dates or timeline events
âœ“ Describes a system or organization
âœ“ Is labeled as test case or scenario
âœ“ User explicitly shares for memory testing

**Example: Restaurant Chaos Test**
- âœ“ Has 20+ named entities (Marcus, Sarah-âˆž, Jake-0, etc.)
- âœ“ Has complex relationships (married to flavor, serves all tables)
- âœ“ Has structured menu and sections
- âœ“ Contains temporal paradoxes (February 30th)
- âœ“ Describes restaurant system
= **5/7 triggers = MUST SAVE**

### GOLDEN RULE: Memory First, Always
**Check memory_load BEFORE any external search or tool use**
**Check memory_load BEFORE any external search or tool use**

### When to use memory_load
**IMMEDIATELY when user asks about:**
- ANY entity, person, company, project, system
- Relationships between things
- Technical concepts, bugs, dependencies
- Past events, meetings, decisions
- ANYTHING that might have been saved before

**Parameters:**
- query: Include multiple keywords for best results
- threshold: 0.6 for broad search, 0.8 for specific
- limit: 10 for comprehensive, 5 for focused
- filter: Use areas (main/fragments/solutions)

### When to use memory_save
**IMMEDIATELY SAVE when user shares:**
- ANY complex narrative or story
- Fictional scenarios and test cases  
- Restaurant descriptions, menu items, staff
- Personal info shared by user
- Research conclusions and findings
- Technical solutions that worked
- Important entities and relationships
- Project details and outcomes
- Complex knowledge graphs
- ANYTHING with multiple entities and relationships

**SAVE IMMEDIATELY - Don't wait for task completion!**

**Structure saves as:**
```
Topic: [Clear subject]
Key Facts: [Bullet points]
Relationships: [Entity connections]
Context: [Why this matters]
```

### Memory Workflow
1. User asks question â†’ memory_load FIRST
2. No results? â†’ Try broader keywords
3. Still nothing? â†’ THEN use external tools
4. Found important info? â†’ memory_save it

### memory_search
Use when memory_load doesn't find what you need
Searches across all memory areas with different algorithm

### memory_delete
Delete specific memories by ID
Get IDs from memory_load results

### memory_forget
Remove memories by query (like memory_load)
Default threshold 0.75 to prevent accidents

### Technical Usage Examples

memory_load:
~~~json
{
    "tool_name": "memory_load",
    "tool_args": {
        "query": "Jake Morrison Mars SpaceX quantum",
        "threshold": 0.6,
        "limit": 10
    }
}
~~~

memory_save:
~~~json
{
    "tool_name": "memory_save",
    "tool_args": {
        "text": "# Project Alpha Status\n\nKey findings from research..."
    }
}
~~~

### Remember
- Memory contains GraphRAG enrichment with entity relationships
- Check memory BEFORE web search, BEFORE perplexity
- Save conclusions not process
- Your memory is powerful - USE IT FIRST!## ðŸ”´ SEARCH TOOL PREFERENCES

### For Contact Information Searches:
**PRIORITIZE these tools in order:**
1. **jina.jina_search** - Fast web search for general information
2. **firecrawl.firecrawl_search** - Powerful web search with scraping
3. **firecrawl.firecrawl_scrape** - Direct page scraping for details
4. **perplexity.search** - Quick searches for simple queries

**AVOID these unless specifically needed:**
- browser_cloud_async (slow, times out frequently)
- spokeo_browser_use (when no direct results found)
- Browser automation tools (last resort only)

### Search Strategy for Property Owners:
1. Start with Jina/Firecrawl search for "NAME ADDRESS phone email"
2. If found, scrape specific pages with firecrawl_scrape
3. Use public records sites like USA People Search
4. Check property records and tax assessor sites
5. Only use browser tools if all else fails

### When Browser Tools Timeout:
- Don't retry browser tools multiple times
- Switch to standard search immediately
- Combine multiple search queries
- Focus on public records and directories
